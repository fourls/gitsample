        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm John! I'm a software engineer who loves to code and solve problems. When I'm not working, you can
            find me hiking in the mountains or playing guitar at home. I'm passionate about learning new
            technologies and improving my skills, and I'm always looking to collaborate with others on
            interesting projects. Let's connect and see how we can work together!</p>
