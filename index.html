        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm John! I'm a software engineer who loves to code and solve problems. When I'm not working, you can
            find me hiking in the mountains or playing guitar in my backyard. I'm passionate about learning new
            technologies and improving my skills, and I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others on
            interesting projects. Let's connect and see how we can work together!</p>
